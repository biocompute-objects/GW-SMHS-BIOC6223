Further Research: Connecting platforms, pipelines, and tools
===================================
10/8-10/13

For the 2 platforms- [CGC](http://cgc.sbgenomics.com) & [HIVE](https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=home) shown to you in class: 

In groups of 3, students will produce 1 paragraph detailing
   * Tools I looked for (these are the tools outlined in your BCOs from the publications)
   * Briefly what the tools do
   * Were they found in the platforms - Y/N
   * If not: 
      * What the similar/equivalent ones would be AND
      * email the point of contact for CGC and HIVE explaining with this paragraph (You will be provided these contacts) what tools you did not find on the platform. 

Once the assigment (with both parts- HIVE and CGC) is complete, submit to [Further research documents folder](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223).   

## Groups/ times
The group and times for this assignment are below. These instructions can be found in [4_FurtherResearch.md](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/blob/master/docs/4_FurtherResearch.md)

HIVE Sign-up *Only one individual per group needs to come for the HIVE portion of this assignment. It will not take more than 20 minutes. Please email janishapatel@gwu.edu to reserve your time and please state your group # Thank you!

Times:
Wednesday 10/9 1-5pm ;
Thursday 10/10 9-5pm ;
Friday 10/11 9-4pm 

Location: Ross Hall 559

Note: Since only one individual is required to come in and search HIVE for the tools, I highly recommend that individual comes with the list of tools in your pipeline. Next to each tool, indicate whether or not the tool was found in HIVE. If not, write an equivalent tool that was found in HIVE.As a group, follow the same steps for CGC and create 1 paragraph (template at the bottom of this page)

## Instructions
  
1. Create the document (Either locally or on Github)    
    Local: Save on your computer in txt format (Name it "Group#_FurtherResearch"). Upload the document to the [Further research documents folder](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223)          
   OR       
   Github: create a new file ("Group#_FurtherResearch.md) in the [Further research documents folder](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223) and write the paragraph there.
   
   In your Pull Request, please select appropriate:
      * **label** : "midterm: Further Research"
      * **assignee**: "Janisha Patel"
      * **milestone**: "Further Research"
  
Note: only one team member needs to do this:    

2.  If there were tools not found in HIVE or CGC, draft individual emails to them respectively with this information. Template email can be found below. Points of Contact for HIVE and CGC will be provided directly to the groups.    
 
# Deliverables
Two deliverables for this assignment: 1 paragraph document + 2 separate emails to the HIVE and CGC contact. (To clarify: each team must send 1 email to HIVE and 1 email to CGC). Due: 10/13

### Paragraph Template:   
Only for reference- this should not be a direct copy/paste     
" Our publication utilized 6 tools:  TopHat in Step 1,  [Tool2] in Step 2, [Tool3] in Step 3, [Tool4] in Step 4, [Tool5]in Step 5, [Tool6] in Step 6. Tool 1's purpose was to align [X] reads to [X] genomes. Tool 1 was found in the CGC, but was not found in the HIVE Platform. An equivalent tool found in the HIVE platform was HIVE Hexagon..... Tool 2's purpose was ____ ....not found either CGC or HIVE.... 
  ... .. 
An email has been sent to HIVE Platform and CGC's points of contact with the the respective tools not found in their platform as feedback."
  
### Email template: 
Only for reference- this should not be a direct copy/paste

"I am a graduate student at George Washington University taking x class. I have created a BCO for x publication, and looking to see if the workflow outlined in the publication can be reproducible in different cloud computing platforms.  I was unable to find the following tools from the workflows in the CGC : x, y, z. I did, however find these alternatives: a, b, c. My instructor (as requested by Dr. Dennis Dean) has prompted me to provide this feedback."
