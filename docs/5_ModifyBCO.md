Modify and Finalize your BCO
===================================
10/8/19 - 10/18/19

## Instructions

From 10/8-10/13, your reviewer will provide actionable feedback in the form of issues. In the meantime, your task will be [Further Research](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/blob/master/4_FurtherResearch.md). In addition, it's highly recommended that you check in on your Project Board **daily** for reviewer feedback. 

Each student will have at least 5 days (from 10/13-10/18) to intake feedback and implement the requested changes to finalize your BCO. You can reply to the feedback for clarification or further discussion- however, please provide your reviewer at least 48 hours to respond. Meaning: the latest we can guarantee your comment will be addressed/answered in time for your submission will be 10/16.

Please review GitHub issue [#104](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/issues/104) for detailed. instructions.

Note: students should refer to 
  BIOC6223 Lecture #1 BioCompute Introduction for help
  [Specification document](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification)
  [User guide] (https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification/blob/master/user_guide.md)
  
Please work individually (unless specificied otherwise in the feedback issue).
