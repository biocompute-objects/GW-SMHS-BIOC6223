Modify and Finalize your BCO
===================================
10/8/19 - 10/18/19

## Instructions

From 10/8-10/13, your reviewer will provide actionable feedback in the form of issues. In the meantime, your task will be [Further Research](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/blob/master/4_FurtherResearch.md). In addition, it's highly recommended that you check in on your Project Board **daily** for reviewer feedback. 

Each student will have at least 5 days (from 10/13-10/18) to intake feedback and implement the requested changes to finalize your BCO. You can reply to the feedback for clarification or further discussion- however, please provide your reviewer at least 48 hours to respond. Meaning: the latest we can guarantee your comment will be addressed/answered in time for your submission will be 10/16.

Note: the below instructions are also located in GitHub issue [#104](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/issues/104).

From **10/13-10/17,** using the BCO editor, please **modify your BCO** according to the feedback provided (via Github issues). All feedback will be provided by Sunday 10/13 11:59pm.  This issue has been placed as a card in the "To Do" column of your individual projects. 

### Steps:
1. Find the issues relevant to your BCO.  (Hint: you can find feedback for your BCO by filtering the [Issues](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/issues) by Assignee (you).  
3. Modify and save your BCO on the [BCO Editor](https://biocomputeobject.org/bco_editor_tst/).
4. Once all modifications are complete, copy and paste the new JSON into the existing BCO you've submitted in the Students_BCO folder on Github. 
4.  When you commit the changes, this will generate a pull request. Please add the following tags to the request: 
- Label : "midterm: submission" 
- Assignees : "Janisha Patel"
- Project : "[Your project']"
- Milestone : "Final BCO"

In the description of your request, please indicate: "My BCO is ready for final review before pFDA submission."
## Your pull request for your modified BCO should be sent in with the appropriate tags by 5pm on 10/17. 
Any later and there is no guarantee your BCO will be approved.

5. **If all modifications are made, @jpat1546  will then comment "BCO approved" in the issue with the following instructions to change the reviewer section prior to submitting to pFDA:**

    Once you've received "BCO approved" comment, please make the following 2 changes to your BCO in the BCO Editor: 
    In Provenance domain:
    - reviewer status from "in-review" to "approved"
    - reviewer_comment from "Reviewed by BioCompute technical assistant, approval pending modification by author" to "Reviewed and approved by BioCompute technical assistant."

### Do not submit to the pFDA challenge until you have received the "BCO approved comment" from either @jpat1546 or @kee007ney.

Once you have received the "BCO approved" comment on your pull request AND modified the review status, please submit to the pFDA challenge.
