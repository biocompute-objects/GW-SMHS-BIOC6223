Create first BCO draft
===================================
10/3/19

## Instructions
1. Create the  BCO draft #1 using the [BioCompute Editor](biocomputeobject.org/bco_editor_tst/) and [Specification document](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification) for reference. **Note:** While this is a primary draft, part of your score comes from this initial submission- the other portion will be from the pFDA submission.

2. Download your BCO from the BCO Editor, submit  BCO to Blackboard in .txt format and to "Student_BCOs" folder in GitHub [repository](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223). In the "Student_BCOs" folder, click "Upload file" and upload your  BCO (downloaded to your machine from the Editor). Provide a title- if it's a WIP BCO, label the title WIP+ yourname. This will redirect you to a pull request page, where you should select the appropriate:
  * **label** : "midterm: BCO Submission"
  * **assignee**: "Jonathon Keeney" (NOTE: If still a WIP, do NOT assign anyone)
  * **project**: Your project name, according to the [README](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/blob/master/README.md)
  * **milestone**: "BCO draft"


IF YOU CREATED A WIP PULL REQUEST DURING CLASS, HERE ARE YOU'RE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS EVENING (10/8): 
1. Edit and finalize your BCO in the BCO Editor
2. Download this final draft 
3. Modify this pull request  with the new BCO
