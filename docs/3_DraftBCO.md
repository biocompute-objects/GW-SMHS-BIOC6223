## Instructions
1. Create the  BCO draft #1 using the BioCompute Editor and [Specification document](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification) for reference. **Note:** While this is a primary draft, part of your score comes from this initial submission- the other portion will be from the pFDA submission.

  * **project**: Your project name, according to the [README](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/blob/master/README.md)
  * **milestone**: "BCO draft"
