Further Research: Connecting platforms, pipelines, and tools
===================================
10/8-10/13

## Instructions

For the 2 platforms- [CGC](http://cgc.sbgenomics.com) & [HIVE](https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=home) shown to you in class: 

In groups of 3, students will produce 1 paragraph detailing
1) Tools I looked for (these are the tools outlined in your BCOs from the publications)
2) Briefly what the tools do
3) Were they found in the platforms - Y/N
4) If not: 
    * What the similar/equivalent ones would be AND
    * email the point of contact for CGC and HIVE explaining with this paragraph (You will be provided these contacts) what tools you did not find on the platform. 

Once the assigment (with both parts- HIVE and CGC is complete), submit this to [Further research documents folder](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223). Instructions:
   1. Create the document locally on your computer in txt format. Please upload the document to the [Further research documents folder](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223).
   In your Pull Request, please select appropriate:
  * **label** : "midterm: Further Research"
  * **assignee**: "Janisha Patel"
  * **milestone**: "Further Research"
  
  2. If there were tools not found in HIVE or CGC, draft individual emails to them respectively with this information. Email details can be found below. 
 

# Deliverables
Two deliverables for this assignment: 1 paragraph document + 2 separate emails to the HIVE and CGC contact.
Due: 10/13

------      

### Details for paragraph:     

Note: Since only one individual is required to come in and search HIVE for the tools, I highly recommend that individual comes with the list of tools in your pipeline. Next to each tool, indicate whether or not the tool was found in HIVE. If not, write an equivalent tool that was found in HIVE. 

As a group, follow the same steps for CGC and create 1 paragraph. A template would be:
  " Our publication utilized 6 tools:  TopHat in Step 1,  [Tool2] in Step 2, [Tool3] in Step 3, [Tool4] in Step 4, [Tool5]in Step 5, [Tool6]in Step 6. Tool 1's purpose was to align [X] reads to [X] genomes. Tool 1 was found in the CGC, but was not found in the HIVE Platform. An equivalent tool found in the HIVE platform was HIVE Hexagon..... Tool 2's purpose was ____ ....not found either CGC or HIVE.... 
  ... .. 
An email will be sent to the point of contact HIVE Platform and CGC for the respective tools not found in their platform."
  
### Details for email:
In the format of "I am a graduate  student in the George Washington University taking x class.......I have created a BCO for x publication (cite appropriately), and the following tools in the workflow were not found in the platform"
