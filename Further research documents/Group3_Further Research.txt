For further research:	
	The pipeline introduced in the publication includes 5 tools: Step 1 used BioBloomTools (BBT), Step 2 used Trans-ABySS, Step 3 used Genomic Mapping and Alignment Program for mRNA and EST Sequences (GMAP) and Burrow-Wheeler Aligner for short-read alignment (BWA-MEM), Step 4 used Post Assembly Variant Finder (PAVFinder).
	 BBT was used to Classify and segregate whole-sample RNA-seq reads into bins corresponding to specific gene targets. BBT could not be found either on CGC or the HIVE platform. An equivalent tool found on the HIVE platform was HIVE Hexagon, and the Centrifuge 1.0.3 toolkit on CGC. The purpose of the Trans-ABySS was to reconstruct transcripts with a range of expression levels and sequence complexity. Trans-ABySS was also not found either on CGC or HIVE. But an alternative toolkit Trinity 2.4.0 was found on CGC and HIVE Small Genome de Novo and Assembly (Viral/ Bacterial) via IDBA-HYBRID one HIVE platform.GMAP and BWA-MEM was used to provide support evidence and read counts of single variant (SV) calls. The GMAP tool could not be found on both CGC and HIVE, however, the BROAD Best Practices RNA-Seq Variant Calling 4.1.0.0 workflow on CGC could be considered to be an alternative and the BWA-MEM bundle could be found on CGC. The purpose of PAVFinder was detection of SV. An equivalent tool found in the HIVE platform was Structure Feature Analysis Tool(SFAT). An email has been sent to HIVE Platform and CGC's contact team with the respective tools not found in their platform as our feedback.
