HIVE Portion    
TOOLs: TopHat and Bowtie 1    
    TopHat uses the bowtie tool to look at unmapped reads and align them according to splicing junctions.
    These tools are found in HIVE as third-party tools. HIVE has them integrated in the HIVE-hexagon tool, which is used for sequence alignments on HIVE.    
TOOL: UCSC Genome browser table
    This tool proved alignemnt comparisons to already provided genes with in the genome browser table.
   This tool is not in HIVE, there is no alternative in HIVE.
TOOL: Gene Ontology Biological Process(GO_BP)   
    This tool is controlled vocabulary for classification of gene function and is used to perfom enrichment analysis for an independent biological process with a defined beginning and end.    
    This tool is not in HIVE, there is no alternative in HIVE.
TOOL: Gene Ontology Cellular Component (GO_CC)    
    This tool contains controlled vocabulary for the classification of gene functions, and is used to perfom enrichment analysis for a cellular structure.    
    This tool is not in HIVE, there is no alternative in HIVE.
TOOL: KEGGpathway   
    This tool is an integrated database used for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data.
