HIVE Portion    
TOOLs: TopHat and Bowtie 1    
    TopHat uses the bowtie tool to look at unmapped reads and align them according to splicing junctions.
    These tools are found in HIVE as third-party tools. HIVE has them integrated in the HIVE-hexagon tool, which is used for sequence alignments on HIVE.    
TOOL: UCSC Genome browser table.
    This tool can be used to access a reference genome to map exome reads to their parent gene within the genome.
    This tool is not in HIVE, there is an alternative aligner tool called HISAT2 in HIVE-Hexagon, that allows for mapping of reads to the whole genome.     
TOOL: Bioconductor Rankprod     
    This tool is used for differential gene expression analysis.
       This tool is not in HIVE, but there is an alternatie tool called BioXpress for DESeq within HIVE.  
TOOL: Gene Ontology Biological Process(GO_BP)   
    This tool is controlled vocabulary for classification of gene function and is used to perfom enrichment analysis for an independent biological process with a defined beginning and end.    
    This tool is not in HIVE, there is no alternative in HIVE.      
TOOL: Gene Ontology Cellular Component (GO_CC)    
    This tool contains controlled vocabulary for the classification of gene functions, and is used to perfom enrichment analysis for a cellular structure.    
    This tool is not in HIVE, there is no alternative in HIVE.      
TOOL: KEGGpathway   
    This tool is an integrated database used for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data.    
    This tool is not in HIVE, there is no alternative in HIVE.
