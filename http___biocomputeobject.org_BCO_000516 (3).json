    "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) shed from primary tumors play a key role in tumor metastasis, yet the transcriptional profiling of CTCs has not been fully elucidated.  This workflow serves to undertake detailed analysis of the composition of pancreatic cancer CTCs using single-cell RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression and gene-set enrichment analysis.  To achieve RNA-sequencing profiles of CTCs at the single-cell level, a high-throughput microfluidic cell-separation device was used for enrichment of CTCs, which were then subjected to single cell micromanipulation.  Gene expression profiles of single cell CTCs were compared with that of matched primary tumors in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, which led to the identification of three distinct CTC populations, which clustered separately from primary tumors and tumor-derived cell lines and exhibited particularly high expression levels of extracellular matrix genes.  This BCO was created based on the workflow from Ting et. al.  doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2014.08.029"
