        "This BCO was adapted by: Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies extracellular matrix gene expression by pancreatic circulating tumor cells by Ting, David T et al (2014). The main objective was to identify the expression of extracellular matrix genes in mouse pancreatic CTCs and human CTCs originating from the pancreas, breasts, and prostate.",

        "Description: After being shed from primary tumors, circulating tumor cells (CTC) are able to infiltrate and spread cancerous material to various organs in the human body via the bloodstream. Though CTCs are rare, the metastatic nature of these cells encourage researchers to focus on and develop therapeutic target treatment methods. Ting et al. were able to compare multiple genome-wide expression profiles of CTCs, which were then matched to the original tumors. Genetically engineered mouse pancreatic cancer models were used in the experiment in order to compare to Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in humans. Individual CTCs were isolated from cells using purification and selection methods and were then subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing. CTC gene sequencing, processing, and enrichment was done by utilizing various metadata, databases, tools, and programs. The authors successfully observed high expression of stromal-derived extracellular matrix proteins in both mouse and human pancreatic CTCs. The experimental evidence supported the conclusion that CTC expression mediates metastatic invasion to distant organs. "
