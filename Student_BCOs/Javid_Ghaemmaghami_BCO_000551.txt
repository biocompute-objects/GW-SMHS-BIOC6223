        "In the article titled RNA-Seq Analysis of Differential Splice Junction Usage and Intron Retentions by DEXSeq Li et al., showed that through their method DEXSeq can be used to conduct differential analysis on count table as well as reference file of splice junctions (SJs) and intron retentions (IRs). Differential analysis by DEXSeq can be later used to help identify of splicing events. The genomic positions of splice junctions depicted by DEXSeq can be further analyzed through MEME suite to perform a sequence motif search depicting the pattern of splicing events. Li et al. used RNA-seq data from Drosophila to conduct differential analysis of SJs and IRs. To show that their method can also be used to study human disease implicated by alternative splicing events, the paper used RNA-seq data from Human breast cancer and Arabidopsis to conduct SJs and IRs differential analysis. Since IR is very rare in mammals (3%), Arabdiopsis was used to conduct IR analysis with Python script dexseq_prepare_annotation.py from DEXSeq to generate intron reference files. The dexseq_count.py application in DEXSeq was then used to generate count tables of IRs. The count table and reference file were later put into DEXSeq as inputs for differential analysis of IR. In this BCO the pipeline provided shows the location of SJs as well as the differential analysis of these SJs with the Human Breast Cancer data set. The IR analysis of Arabdiopsis is not included in this pipeline since SJ genomic coordinates can later be used to conduct a sequence motif search and possibly help better understand the mechanism of disease development and the transcription process itself."

The input file is also the significant SJs in Drosophila provided by DEXSeq differential analysis. Sequence motif searchers were conducted by MEME suite on the human breast cancer SJ dataset but were not provided for by the paper. The input and output file here are to serve as examples that a sequence motif search can be conducted with the known SJ positions to conduct further human disease mechanism analysis as well as alternative splicing analysis."
