        " Total RNA was extracted from ten samples of cancer tissue(invasive ductal carcinoma; luminal B subtype) and three samples of adjacent normal tissue from a Korean patient with invasive ductal carcinoma. Transcriptomes of breast cancer and normal samples were profiled  via RNA-seq. Differentially expressed genes were identified with an FDR-adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.55. Gene ontology analysis indicated that several pathways are associated with the onset and progression of invasive ductal carcinoma. "
