    "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) shed from primary tumors play a key role in tumor metastasis, yet the transcriptional profiling of CTCs has not been fully elucidated.  This workflow serves to undertake detailed analysis of the composition of pancreatic cancer CTCs using single-cell RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression analysis and gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA).  To achieve RNA-sequencing profiles of CTCs at the single-cell level, a high-throughput inertial focusing-enhanced microfluidic CTC separation device, termed the CTC-iChip, was used for enrichment of CTCs (PMID 23552373), which were then subjected to single cell micromanipulation and sequencing (PMID 20203668).  Gene expression profiles of single cell CTCs were compared with that of matched primary tumors in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, which led to the identification of three distinct CTC populations, which clustered separately from primary tumors and tumor-derived cell lines and exhibited particularly high expression levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes (GEO GSE51372, GSE60407).  This BCO was created based on the workflow from Ting et al.  doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2014.08.029"

In this study's pipeline, TopHat version 2.0.4 and Bowtie1 version 0.12.7 were used to align color space reads with the no-novel-juncs argument set with UCSC mouse genome version mm9 and transcriptome defined by the UCSC mm9 genes knownGene table from http://genome.ucsc.edu.  Reads that were unaligned or aligned to multiple locations (i.e. did not map uniquely) were discarded.  Each aligned read was mapped to its respective gene using the mm9 knownToLocusLink table from http://genome.ucsc.edu.  The read count for each gene (i.e. the number of reads mapped to a gene) was normalized to Reads Per Million mapped reads (rpm) by dividing the read count for each gene by the total number of reads that were mapped to any gene and then multiplying by one million to form the reads-per-million (rpm) count.  The authors of the study used rpm, rather than Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (rpkm), because of a 3' bias in the alignments due to the sequencing protocol's oligo-dT reverse transcription method with only one cDNA per transcript."

Data scaling for the heatmaps was in log10(rpm).  (A log10(rpm) matrix was generated by log10-transforming the rpm count matrix.)"

In this study's pipeline, the Rank Product (RP) function of the Bioconductor RankProd package version 2.28.0 was used to determine false discovery rate (FDR) estimates for differentially expressed (both up- and down- regulated) genes from the log10(rpm) matrix.  In the log10(rpm) matrix, any rows for which the 90th percentile of the values was less than log10(10) were removed before utilizing the RP function of the Bioconductor RankProd package.  The authors considered genes to be differentially expressed if the FDR estimate was less than 0.01."
